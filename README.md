#Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as <a href="https://github.com/manishmarahatta/ama/issues">creating a new issue </a>on this project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.
